# SearchPic

SearchPic is a web application that uses [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) to search pictures by tag and text.

To use the application you just type what would you like to search for and hit enter or click on the 'Search' button.

You can also change the type of search by changing the search option on the left of the search bar input.

After the search is completed, the application shows 20 pictures related to the subject and divided by cards. Each card contains the name of the user who posted the photo, the picture it selfs, it's title, tags and at bottom the taken date.

Besides that, you can scroll to the end of the page and it will automatically show you more 20 related pictures.
